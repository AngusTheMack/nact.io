My previous job had a .NET stack, which is where I'd learnt Akka. I'd come to really appreciate the benefits and constraints provided by an actor system. Root's stack used Node.js however, and while there are one or two actor frameworks available, it felt that they had quite different goals: focusing on performance first. From my experience introducing Akka to my colleagues, I feel that getting the ergonomics and pedagogical aspects right from the start is of greater importance. Nact is thus being designed to make it easy for software teams to fall into the pit of success. </p>\n<p>This year most of the important building blocks were added to the framework, first class <a href=\"http://reasonml.github.io/\">ReasonML</a> bindings\nwere released, and the website you're reading this on was published. </p>\n<p>I was fortunate to join Root at a stage where the company doesn't face scaling problems. Thus we were able to adopt nact purely for it's event sourcing capabilities. Adding clustering is a priority for 2018, <em>especially</em> to support Root's move to kubernetes. </p>\n<p>Other goals for 2018 are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Further improvement to the documentation</li>\n<li>Tooling for logging and monitoring</li>\n<li>Better error messages</li>\n<li>Support for more storage providers</li>\n<li>A library which implements common patterns (such as at-least once delivery, scheduled jobs, the repository pattern, etc.) to reduce boilerplate code</li>\n<li>Eliminating the rxjs dependency.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you're interested in nact, would like to contribute to the framework, have suggestions, complaints or any comments, please reach out.

This abstraction allowed developers to focus on writing domain code without worrying about locking, staleness, or even on what core/machine the process was located. A cluster can be similarly abstracted. This allows developers to worry less about networking, load balancing, and service discovery, and more about solving domain problems at scale. </p>\n<p>I\'ve been thinking hard about what such an abstraction would look like, and <em>think</em> I have something which could work. Obviously this is all subject to change, and a lot of hard work will need to be done to make it a reality (failure detection, gossiping, sharding, membership and so on) but I\'d be very happy if Nact clustering could look something like this:</p>\n<p>This is the ReasonML version:</p>\n<div class="gatsby-highlight">\n      <pre class="language-reason"><code><span class="token keyword">let</span>

example, the system is fed a set of well known addresses to bootstrap discovery of peer nodes.\nThen a virtual cluster is created. This cluster has a particular routing strategy (in this case round robin)\nas different routing strategies have different consistency requirements. </p>\n<p>The <code>clusterRef</code> supports two additional operations: <code>join</code> and <code>leave</code> or the <code>+@</code> and <code>-@</code> operators in Reason respectively. Messages can be dispatched to the cluster as per usual. In the Reason version, the <code>clusterRef</code> and\n<code>actorRef</code> are separate so as to simplify typing.</p>\n<p>This clustering design feels ergonomic, fairly simple for the end user and flexible.
